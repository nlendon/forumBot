Forum Manager BOT by nLendon
This bot was created for the Maze Role Play project. You can use it for other projects, because it is open access. When using, indicate the developer.

HOW TO START PROJECT:

1. Create a token on behalf of the VK community.
2. Inside the folder create .env file, and insert into there this:

    1.TOKEN= *Your Token*
    2.HOST= MYSQL data base Host
    3.USER= MYSQL data base User
    4.PASS= MYSQL data base Password
    5.DB= MYSQL data base Database

3. Then enter this command in the terminal - npm start

The project will start on the nodemon module, which is convenient for development
